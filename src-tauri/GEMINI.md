## MUST-DO Rule for AI Agents (Claude and all others)

**Business logic MUST live in the Rust backend (`src-tauri/`). Frontend-only concerns MUST stay in the TypeScript frontend (`app/`).**

- All business logic — data processing, state transitions, persistence, network/IPC, blockchain, crypto, sync, validation, and domain rules — goes in `src-tauri/` (Rust).
- The `app/` TypeScript frontend is for UI, presentation, routing, and user interaction only. It calls into Rust via Tauri `invoke()` and listens to backend events.
- Do NOT implement business logic in TypeScript. If a feature needs logic, add a Rust command in `src-tauri/` and call it from the frontend.
